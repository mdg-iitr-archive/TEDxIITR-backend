Created by Radio Netherlands Worldwide in 2011, the Love Matters web and mobile sites provide easy-to-access information and news on sexuality and sexual health and sex education for teenagers and young adults. In her view, sex education is not a privilege reserved for certain countries, cultures or communities, but an inherent human right. Today, Yadav openly calls for better sex education for India's youth. After more than nine years of tireless campaigning, she perceives a change in urban India’s sexual landscape. More and more, the need for sex education is being publicly discussed. </div>

Created by Radio Netherlands Worldwide in 2011, the Love Matters web and mobile sites provide easy-to-access information and news on sexuality and sexual health and sex education for teenagers and young adults. In her view, sex education is not a privilege reserved for certain countries, cultures or communities, but an inherent human right. Today, Yadav openly calls for better sex education for India's youth. After more than nine years of tireless campaigning, she perceives a change in urban India’s sexual landscape. More and more, the need for sex education is being publicly discussed.</div>
